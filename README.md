Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors AI project! This interactive application uses a webcam to recognize hand gestures in real-time and play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The AI can detect 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissors' gestures using MediaPipe and OpenCV, providing a fun and engaging experience.
